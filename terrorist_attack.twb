              <bucket>&quot;11/26/2008: On Wednesday night, after attacking the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, assailants Khan and Kasab opened fire on four policemen in their vehicle as they were approaching Cama Hospital near the Metro cinema.  As the vehicle entered the hospital premises, Khan and Kasab emerged from behind a tree and opened fire.  All but one, constable Sanjay Jadhav, died inside the car.  The three policemen killed were identified as Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare, additional commissioner of police Ashok Kamte and encounter cop Vijay Salaskar.  Khan and Kasab dumped the bodies and took the police car. Ultimately they encountered a Skoda police barricade at Girguam Chowpatty where Ismail Khan was killed and Mohammed Kasab was captured and received a bullet injury to the hand. The attack was one of eight coordinated attacks at various locations in Mumbai on 11/26/2008 to 11/29/2008 in which a total of 171 people were killed and 250 were wounded.  Deccan Mujahedeen, a previously unknown group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The claim has not been confirmed. Officials suspected Pakistan’s Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT) were responsible for the attack, although a spokesman for the LeT denied its involvement.  Ajmal Kasab told authorities that the attack was a plan devised six months prior that hoped to kill 5,000 people, targeting whites who were preferably Americans or British. According to Kasab, the assailants posed as students during a visit to Mumbai during the previous month to familiarize themselves with the city’s roads and to film the “strike locations”. Kasab confessed to being a member of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT), belonging to the LeT’s Fidayeen (suicide squad).  He also identified the masterminds of the attack, who were detained after a raid on an LeT camp on 12/07/2008 and formally indicted on 05/12/2009 for their involvement in the attacks.  In May 2010, Kasab was convicted and sentenced to death for his role in the attacks.&quot;</bucket>

The attack was one of eight coordinated attacks at various locations in Mumbai on 11/26/2008 to 11/29/2008 in which a total of 171 people were killed and 250 were wounded.

Ajmal Kasab, an assailant captured on 11/26/2008, told authorities that the attack was a plan devised six months prior that hoped to kill 5,000 people, targeting whites who were preferably Americans or British. According to Kasab, the assailants posed as students during a visit to Mumbai during the previous month to familiarize themselves with the city’s roads and to film the “strike locations”. Kasab confessed to being a member of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT), belonging to the LeT’s Fidayeen (suicide squad).  He also identified the masterminds of the attack, who were detained after a raid on an LeT camp on 12/07/2008 and formally indicted on 05/12/2009 for their involvement in the attacks.  In May 2010, Kasab was convicted and sentenced to death for his role in the attacks.&quot;</bucket>

At least 7 people were killed in the attack on the café.  Farhang Jehani and his brother, whose family have owned Cafe Leopold for decades, were both watching a cricket match on a TV in the upstairs bar when the gunmen lobbed the grenade inside. This is one of eight coordinated attacks occurring at various locations in Mumbai that killed a total of 171 people and wounded 250 over the course of three days. Deccan Mujahedeen, a previously unknown group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The claim has not been confirmed. Officials suspected Pakistan’s Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT) were responsible for the attack, although a spokesman for the LeT denied its involvement.  Ajmal Kasab, an assailant captured on 11/26/2008, told authorities that the attack was a plan devised six months prior that hoped to kill 5,000 people, targeting whites who were preferably Americans or British. According to Kasab, the assailants posed as students during a visit to Mumbai during the previous month to familiarize themselves with the city’s roads and to film the “strike locations”. Kasab confessed to being a member of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT), belonging to the LeT’s Fidayeen (suicide squad).  He also identified the masterminds of the attack, who were detained after a raid on an LeT camp on 12/07/2008 and formally indicted on 05/12/2009 for their involvement in the attacks.  In May 2010, Kasab was convicted and sentenced to death for his role in the attacks.&quot;</bucket>

Ajmal Kasab, an assailant captured on 11/26/2008, told authorities that the attack was a plan devised six months prior that hoped to kill 5,000 people, targeting whites who were preferably Americans or British. According to Kasab, the assailants posed as students during a visit to Mumbai during the previous month to familiarize themselves with the city’s roads and to film the “strike locations.” Kasab confessed to being a member of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT), belonging to the LeT’s Fidayeen (suicide squad). He also identified the masterminds of the attack, who were detained after a raid on an LeT camp on 12/07/2008 and formally indicted on 05/12/2009 for their involvement in the attacks.

The two assailants who attacked the Jewish community centre in Nariman house in the Colaba area were identified as Nasir alias Abu Umar from Faisalabad and Babar Imran alias Abu Akasha from Multan. At the Jewish center, perpetrators took hostage Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg; Holtsberg&apos;s wife, Rivka; and four other visitors to the center.  The Holtzbergs&apos; 2-year-old son, Moshe, was whisked out of the building by his nanny and another worker.  A passerby was killed when the two attackers stepped out on the balcony and opened fire on an alley nearby. All six hostages were discovered dead when officials stormed the Jewish center after two days of the siege.   Deccan Mujahedeen, a previously unknown group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The claim has not been confirmed. Officials suspected Pakistan’s Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT) were responsible for the attack, although a spokesman for the LeT denied its involvement.  Ajmal Kasab, an assailant captured on 11/26/2008, told authorities that the attack was a plan devised six months prior that hoped to kill 5,000 people, targeting whites who were preferably Americans or British. According to Kasab, the assailants posed as students during a visit to Mumbai during the previous month to familiarize themselves with the city’s roads and to film the “strike locations”. Kasab confessed to being a member of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT), belonging to the LeT’s Fidayeen (suicide squad).  He also identified the masterminds of the attack, who were detained after a raid on an LeT camp on 12/07/2008 and formally indicted on 05/12/2009 for their involvement in the attacks.  In May 2010, Kasab was convicted and sentenced to death for his role in the attacks.&quot;</bucket>

This is one of eight coordinated attacks occurring at various locations in Mumbai  that killed a total of 171 people and wounded 250 over the course of three days.  In the attack on the Oberoi-Trident hotel complex, two gunmen identified by Police official Maria as Abdul Rehman alias Abdul Rehman Chhota from Multan and Fahadullah alias Abu Fahad from Okara, took over 143 people hostage and killed at least 32 people. Among those killed in the attack were 10 staff members and 22 hotel guests.  Victims reported that a gunman had ushered 30 or 40 people from the restaurant into a stairway and, speaking in Hindi or Urdu, ordered them to put up their hands. Another gunman was reportedly firing indiscriminately around the room. Deccan Mujahedeen, a previously unknown group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The claim has not been confirmed. Officials suspected Pakistan’s Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT) were responsible for the attack, although a spokesman for the LeT denied its involvement.  Ajmal Kasab, an assailant captured on 11/26/2008, told authorities that the attack was a plan devised six months prior that hoped to kill 5,000 people, targeting whites who were preferably Americans or British. According to Kasab, the assailants posed as students during a visit to Mumbai during the previous month to familiarize themselves with the city’s roads and to film the “strike locations”. Kasab confessed to being a member of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT), belonging to the LeT’s Fidayeen (suicide squad).  He also identified the masterminds of the attack, who were detained after a raid on an LeT camp on 12/07/2008 and formally indicted on 05/12/2009 for their involvement in the attacks.
